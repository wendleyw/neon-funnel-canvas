## 🎯 **FIXED: Action Buttons & Click-to-Connect**

### 🔧 **Main Fix Applied**:

- **No more opacity conditions** - buttons show immediately when component is added
- **Enhanced visual design** with background and borders
- **Larger clickable areas** for better usability
- **Clear tooltips** in Portuguese

### ✅ **Available Actions**:
1. **✏️ Editar** - Edit component (shows alert for now)
2. **🔗 Conectar** - Start connection mode (blue highlight when active)
3. **📋 Duplicar** - Duplicate component (shows alert for now)  
4. **🗑️ Excluir** - Delete component (with confirmation dialog)

## 🔍 How to Test the Fixed Features

### 1. Run the project:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 2. **Testing Action Buttons** (NOW WORKING):
1. **Add a component** to the canvas by dragging from sidebar
2. **Action buttons appear immediately** at the bottom of each component
3. **Click any button** to test:
   - ✏️ **Edit**: Shows "Função de edição será implementada em breve!"
   - 🔗 **Connect**: Activates connection mode (button turns blue)
   - 📋 **Duplicate**: Shows "Função de duplicação será implementada em breve!"
   - 🗑️ **Delete**: Shows confirmation dialog, then deletes component

### 3. **Testing Click-to-Connect** (NOW WORKING):
1. **Click the 🔗 Connect button** on any component
2. **See connection mode**: 
   - Source component gets blue glow + floating "🔗 Modo Conexão" indicator
   - Connect button stays highlighted in blue
3. **Click another component**: 
   - Shows green overlay with "🎯 Clique aqui para conectar"
4. **Connection created**: 
   - Animated line appears with pulsing lead node in the middle
   - Connection mode automatically exits

### 4. **Visual Improvements**:
- **📍 Clear selection**: Blue pulsing border around selected components
- **🎨 Action bar**: Dark background with clear button separation
- **💡 Enhanced tooltips**: All in Portuguese with clear descriptions
- **📱 Better feedback**: Immediate visual response to all clicks

## 🎨 Enhanced Visual Design

### Action Button Bar:
- **Background**: Semi-transparent gray (`bg-gray-800/50`)
- **Border**: Subtle gray border for definition
- **Padding**: Generous padding for comfortable clicking
- **Layout**: Edit/Connect/Duplicate on left, Delete on right
- **Hover effects**: Color changes and background highlights

### Selection Indicators:
- **Blue border**: Pulsing border around selected components  
- **Connection mode**: Clear floating indicators with instructions
- **Target mode**: Green overlay with call-to-action text

### Connection Visual Flow:
1. **Click Connect** → Button turns blue
2. **Source indicator** → Floating "Modo Conexão" message  
3. **Target overlay** → Green "Clique aqui" on other components
4. **Connection created** → Animated edge with lead node
5. **Mode exits** → All indicators disappear

## 🔧 Technical Fixes Applied

### 1. Action Button Visibility:
```typescript
// BEFORE (hidden by opacity conditions):
className={`... ${selected ? 'opacity-100' : 'opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100'}`}

// AFTER (always visible):
className="flex items-center justify-between bg-gray-800/50 rounded-lg p-2 border border-gray-700"
```

### 2. Enhanced Click Handlers:
```typescript
// Added proper event handlers with stopPropagation
const handleEdit = (e: React.MouseEvent) => {
  e.stopPropagation();
  console.log('✏️ Edit component:', id);
  alert('Função de edição será implementada em breve!');
};
```

### 3. Global Callback Setup:
```typescript
// Added component deletion callback
(window as any).__onComponentDelete = onComponentDelete;
```

### 4. Debug Logging:
```typescript
// Added selection logging for troubleshooting
React.useEffect(() => {
  if (selected) {
    console.log('✅ Component selected:', id, data.title || template.label);
  }
}, [selected]);
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If Action Buttons Still Don't Appear:
1. **Check console** for "✅ Component selected:" messages
2. **Verify component rendering** - should see action bar at bottom
3. **Try clicking different areas** of the component
4. **Check browser zoom** - ensure it's at 100%

### If Click-to-Connect Still Doesn't Work:
1. **Check console** for "🎯 Node clicked for connection:" messages
2. **Look for blue highlight** on connect button when clicked
3. **Verify floating indicators** appear above source component
4. **Check console** for "✨ Creating connection from X to Y" messages

### Connection Mode Indicators:
- **Source component**: Blue glow + floating "🔗 Modo Conexão" message
- **Target components**: Green overlay + "🎯 Clique aqui para conectar" button
- **Connected**: New animated edge with lead node in middle
